===================

``volume_grating`` is a Python library that makes hologram simulation intuitive and transparent as much as possible. It is written with a proper object-oriented programming mindset where physical entities are properly defined. These physical entities and simulation tools are defined in different classes and modules that are documented in the :ref:`api_main` documentation.
